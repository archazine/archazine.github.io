Cumulative Grade Point Average (or C.G.P.A. for short) for those who are
unacquainted. At the most basic level, the CGPA of a student serves as
his/her performance metric on a cumulative level. It is calculated by
taking the weighted average of the “grade points” obtained by the
student in each course where the “credits” assigned to each course serve
as the weights used in the calculation. The “credits” of a course may be
considered to be proportional to the relative importance of the course
in question.**\
\
**The main vexation amongst students of engineering colleges is that
they are branded with the mark of a C.G.P.A that has a tenacious effect
on every sphere of their existence. This system serves no purpose other
than to aggravate the already existing “rat-race” to such an extent that
anything without credits is considered frivolous. While an ardent debate
on this topic still rages on,  the simple fact cannot be denied that the
current system focuses on academics alone and we know that such a system
simply cannot produce engineers of the “true” sense who are capable of
standing up to the challenges that world has to offer.**\
\
**Consider the following. A student is actively involved in research
work, sports and a plethora of other extra-curricular activities in
campus, but has a low/average C.G.P.A. Is the system justified to
stigmatize him with a mark of “low G.P.A.”? Does he deserve to live with
the tag of being “less capable” and face constant reprimand from his
teachers and parents?**\
There is a tendency among students that they develop inferiority complex
and feel inferior to students having higher C.G.P.A. This is a sign of
low self confidence and self-belief and they take it for granted that
they cannot achieve high C.G.P.A., and thus cannot get a good job. This
is not the solution, do not rate your knowledge and capabilities on the
scale of C.G.P.A. Have confidence and belief in yourself and put your
best foot forward towards your goal with sincerity and hard work without
thinking of a failure and surely you will succeed. For any task in Life,
have the spirit of “YES I CAN”. Always remember “knowledge and hard work
are the only keys that unlock the doors of SUCCESS” .**

Everything said and done, maintaining a good C.G.P.A. is of paramount
importance for every undergraduate student. If needed, take a pause and
read the former line again and again until the inevitable sinks in. A
student with a higher CGPA always gets placed before the one with a
not-so-good CGPA and in most of the cases; the higher CGPA guy will land
a better job. At the end of the day, a high C.G.P.A. is a direct
indicator of one’s sincerity and dedication and that’s what potential
employers are looking for.**\
\
**You have seen both sides of the coin. It is altogether an individual’s
choice as to how much important grades and C.G.P.A. are in his/her life.
To some extent, it also depends on one’s ultimate life goals and
aspirations. But one thing is for certain, there is no gain in
completely ignoring academics. After all, that’s what an engineering
college is all about. **\
