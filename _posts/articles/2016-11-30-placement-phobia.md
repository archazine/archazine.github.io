**6:30 am:** The shrill ringing of the alarm clock declares an end to a
troubled night’s sleep. A hand reaches out from under the blanket and
hits the snooze button, as if in a reflex.\
\
**6:35 am:** The boy finally jumps out of bed with a spine chilling, gut
wrenching realization. It’s **December 1**, more formidably known as the
“**Day Zero”** for the final year students sitting for the campus
placements.\
\
It is said that in moments of near-death experience, your entire life
flashes before your eyes. Something similar is the case at the dawn of
Day Zero. You revisit your entire four years of engineering - countless
mid-sems, end-sems, night-outs, gaming sessions: everything has
culminated to this very day.\
\
**Few hours later**: Enter nervousness. The delirious mind makes you
realize the importance and ubiquity of **Murphy’s Law: “*Anything that
can go wrong, will go wrong*”**. The boy gets dressed in formals,
specifically kept aside for this momentous day constantly being weighed
down by peer pressure, family expectations, the very standards that he
had set for himself. It is then that he realizes the true meaning of the
words “Failure is not an option” that he had carelessly scribbled across
his whiteboard as an inspirational quote.\
\
Countless questions are gnawing his brain as he makes his way to the
placement office. What if today is not my day? What if I’m not able to
give even a single answer? What will my family think of me? How will I
ever face any of my friends? No job, no money. No money, no girls. No
girls, no marriage and no marriage, no happiness. The butterfly effect
of the day’s outcomes does not help in soothing your nerves one bit.\
\
The “boy“ in the above anecdote may not be fictitious. He could be any
one of us. Placements season, that too at a prestigious institute like
the IITs can be a daunting nightmare, even for the well-prepared.
Preparations for this fateful time of the year start months in advance.
Students can be seen revising concepts and solving questions that are
most likely to come up in the written tests and interviews. Some rush to
their seniors seeking company specific advice.

**It’s a mad rat race.** To be honest, no surprises there, everything in
our country seems to be a rat race: school admissions, coaching classes,
engineering entrance exams, C.G.P.A, internships and finally placements.
I seriously doubt **Darwin** could have found any better example to
prove his **“Survival of the Fittest”** theory, had he sneaked a glimpse
of the life of an undergraduate in IIT. The worst part is: no matter
what you do in the rat race, success is not certain. But if you do
nothing, failure is.

Don’t let nervousness, anxiety and overthinking sabotage your four years
hard work, dedication and the efforts which you have put in. Emotions of
few minutes cannot spoil the future. First and foremost, overcome these
small psychological battles to win in the real battle of Life.

Everything said and done, can the trauma, anxiety and sleepless nights
be avoided? Students must understand that in spite of what you feel,
despite what your friends, family or relatives might tell you, this is
not the end of the road. What is important is self-confidence and hope.
Just enjoy the challenges of life and face them with courage and smile.
Overthinking about future may lead to failure. Focus in the present with
utmost sincerity and surely SUCCESS will not be far away. Re-iterating
Andy Dufresne from Shawshank Redemption: ***“Hope is a good thing, maybe
the best of things, and no good thing ever dies”.**\
